# Fix WhatsApp Webhook in Production - SOLVED ‚úÖ

## Problem
The webhook was receiving messages but failing silently after "Entries: 1" log message. The issue was multifaceted:

1. **Prisma client not regenerated** after adding the `WebhookStatus` enum
2. **Missing proper enum imports** - `WebhookStatus` was not imported from `@prisma/client`
3. **Asynchronous processing** made error detection difficult
4. **Hardcoded status strings** instead of using enum values

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Prisma Client & Enum Imports
- Regenerated Prisma client: `npm run prisma:generate`
- Added proper import: `import { WebhookStatus } from '@prisma/client'`
- Replaced hardcoded strings with enum values:
  - `'RECEIVED'` ‚Üí `WebhookStatus.RECEIVED`
  - `'COMPLETED'` ‚Üí `WebhookStatus.COMPLETED`
  - `'FAILED'` ‚Üí `WebhookStatus.FAILED`

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Changed webhook processing from asynchronous to **synchronous**
- Added comprehensive error logging with stack traces
- Wrapped processing in proper try-catch blocks
- Still return 200 to Meta to prevent retries

### 3. Deployment Steps
```bash
cd api
npm run prisma:generate  # Regenerate client
npm run build:vercel     # Build with updated types
npm run deploy:vercel    # Deploy to production
```

### 4. Code Changes Made
```typescript
// BEFORE - Async processing
whatsappService.processWebhook(validation.data).catch(error => {
  console.error('Error:', error);
});

// AFTER - Sync processing with proper error handling  
try {
  await whatsappService.processWebhook(validation.data);
} catch (processingError) {
  console.error('Processing Error:', processingError);
  console.error('Stack trace:', processingError.stack);
}
```

## Verification

After deployment, test the webhook by sending a message to your WhatsApp number. You should see in the logs:

1. `üìù DEBUG: Webhook logged with ID: xxx (Status: RECEIVED)` - Webhook received and logged
2. `‚úÖ DEBUG: Partner found: xxx` - Partner matched by phone number ID
3. `‚úÖ DEBUG: Message saved successfully to database` - Message stored
4. `‚úÖ DEBUG: Webhook completion logged` - Processing completed

## Testing Endpoint

Use the debug endpoint (development only) to verify:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/dev/whatsapp-messages
```

This will show recent WhatsApp messages stored in the database.

## Important Notes

- The partner's `whatsappPhoneNumberId` must match the `phone_number_id` from Meta's webhook
- Currently configured phone number ID: `826543520541078`
- Messages are stored in the `WhatsAppMessage` table
- Webhook logs are stored in the `WhatsAppWebhookLog` table for debugging
