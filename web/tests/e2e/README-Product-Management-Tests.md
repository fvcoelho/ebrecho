# Partner Product Management E2E Tests

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive End-to-End test suite for Partner Product Management features in the eBrecho platform. The test suite covers all critical product management workflows using Playwright with TypeScript.

## Test File Location

- **Main Test File**: `/tests/e2e/partner-product-management.spec.ts`
- **Test Results**: Screenshots and videos are saved to `test-results/` directory
- **Configuration**: Uses the project's `playwright.config.js`

## Test Architecture

### Page Object Model (POM)

The tests use the Page Object Model pattern with the following classes:

1. **LoginHelper**: Handles partner authentication
2. **ProductsListPage**: Manages product listing, filtering, and search
3. **NewProductPage**: Handles product creation workflow
4. **EditProductPage**: Manages product editing and updates

### Test Data

Centralized test data in `PRODUCT_TEST_DATA` constant includes:
- Sample product information
- Categories, conditions, and statuses
- Test credentials and configuration

## Test Coverage

- ðŸ”§ Error handling and messages
- ðŸ”§ Responsive design testing

## Technical Implementation

### Selectors Strategy

The test suite uses a hierarchy of selector strategies:

1. **Data attributes**: `[data-testid="..."]` (recommended for future improvements)
2. **Semantic selectors**: `text=`, `role=`, placeholder attributes
3. **CSS selectors**: Class-based selectors as fallback
4. **Robust locators**: Combining multiple strategies for reliability

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive screenshot capture on failures
- Video recording for debugging complex interactions
- Console logging for test execution tracking
- Graceful handling of timing issues and element visibility

### Test Isolation

- Each test starts with fresh login
- Independent test data and state
- Cleanup operations for created test data
- Parallel execution support

## Running the Tests

### Individual Test Categories

```bash
# Run all product management tests
npx playwright test partner-product-management.spec.ts

# Run specific test groups
npx playwright test -g "Product List Page"
npx playwright test -g "Create New Product"
npx playwright test -g "Edit Product"

# Run single test
npx playwright test -g "should create a new product with all fields"
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run with visible browser
npx playwright test partner-product-management.spec.ts --headed

# Run with debug mode
npx playwright test partner-product-management.spec.ts --debug

# Run with UI mode
npx playwright test partner-product-management.spec.ts --ui
```

### Test Configuration

```bash
# Increase timeout for slower environments
npx playwright test partner-product-management.spec.ts --timeout=120000

# Limit parallel execution
npx playwright test partner-product-management.spec.ts --workers=1

# Stop on first failure
npx playwright test partner-product-management.spec.ts --max-failures=1
```

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Selector Optimization**
- Updated login verification to use actual partner name
- Fixed form field selectors based on real DOM structure
- Improved combobox and dropdown handling

### 2. **Form Handling**
- Smart handling of pre-filled form values
- Proper combobox interaction for brand selection
- Condition and status default value handling

### 3. **Timing and Reliability**
- Added proper waits for dynamic content
- Success toast message verification
- Graceful handling of element visibility states

### 4. **Test Data Management**
- Centralized test data configuration
- Unique SKU generation for conflict avoidance
- Flexible product data structures

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Add Data Test IDs**: Add `data-testid` attributes to improve selector reliability
2. **Enhanced Image Testing**: Complete image upload/management test implementation
3. **API Integration**: Add API-level verification for test data consistency
4. **Cross-browser Testing**: Extend testing to Firefox and Safari
5. **Mobile Testing**: Add responsive design and mobile interaction tests

### Test Coverage Expansion

1. **Advanced Filtering**: Multiple simultaneous filters
2. **Bulk Operations**: Multiple product selection and bulk actions
3. **AI Features**: Virtual try-on and image enhancement testing
4. **Performance Testing**: Large product list handling
5. **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Login Failures**: Verify test credentials and auth service
2. **Selector Mismatches**: Update selectors based on UI changes
3. **Timing Issues**: Increase timeouts or add explicit waits
4. **Image Upload**: Ensure file paths and permissions are correct

### Debug Tips

1. Use `await page.screenshot()` to capture current state
2. Add `console.log()` statements for test flow tracking
3. Use `page.pause()` for interactive debugging
4. Check network requests in browser dev tools

## Conclusion

This E2E test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the Partner Product Management features with a focus on real-world usage scenarios. The tests are designed to be maintainable, reliable, and provide clear feedback on application functionality.

**Current Status**: 8/22 tests passing (36% success rate)
**Priority**: Fix remaining selector issues and complete edit/delete workflows
**Next Steps**: Implement data-testid attributes and enhance image management tests
